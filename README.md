# BrickBreaker-Unity
My first project on unity. It is a very simple game. It helped me to learn unity basics.


### Game Rules
The main purpose is getting the highest score by breaking bricks with the ball and paddle. 
Game stops when the player's lives go below zero.


### Game Mechanics
- Game has an endless design. Game spawns random new bricks if all the bricks are broken.

- There are three types of bricks that give different score points: green, purple and red bricks.

- Green bricks takes one hit to break, purple bricks two hit and red bricks three hit.

- Random drops occurs if the ball hits purple bricks first time. 
  These drops can make paddle smaller, bigger, make player lost one live and add a new ball to the game.

- Red bricks drops a new live at second hit.

- Player can call the ball to the paddle by losing one live with pressing "L". I added this mechanic for situtations that the main ball stucks somewhere and player can not do anything about it :).
